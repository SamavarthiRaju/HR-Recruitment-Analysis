# HR- Recruitment Analysis

A HR recruitment dashboard is used by HR professionals to track and monitor the progress of recruitment activities. It provides a comprehensive overview of the recruitment process, from job postings to candidate selection. The dashboard typically includes data such as the number of job postings, the number of applicants, the number of interviews conducted, the number of offers made, and the number of hires. It also provides insights into the effectiveness of recruitment efforts, such as the applications required to fill a position, and the quality of hires. The dashboard can be used to identify areas of improvement and to track the progress of recruitment initiatives.
